# WaveCity
“Wave City Real Estate” has been designed to manage  Society with House and Owner of house detail.

About the project

In this Wave City Real Estate, the society is categorized by the number of houses. The people who lives in house they may be a owner of house or tenant of house.  In this era, people are very busy with their routine work, so they do not have time for enquiring properly about house they are planning to buy or rent. We have developed the system for society so that the buyer or renter can get the exact details about the owner just by visiting or contacting the Wave City Headquarters. This will help people to not get cheated by someone pretending to be owner of the house. Also the system involves the whole chain on owners since the date of house being allotted.
The system also gives gives information which all houses are available for rent and sale easily. The main purpose of this site is to find out the house for rent and house for buy along with the correct details about owner easily.
